Rajiv Gandhi didn’t misuse INS Viraat, say retired naval officers印度海军退役军官表示，拉吉夫•甘地没有违规使用“维拉特”号航母 http://i.santaihu.com/india/2019-05-10/4d3fee3580229844d6487596f4759bae.jpgNEW DELHI: Top retired naval officers on Thursday strongly refuted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim that Rajiv Gandhi, his family and friends had used aircraft carrier INS Viraat as a “personal taxi” for a 10-day holiday in Lakshadweep in December 1987.新德里：印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪声称，1987年12月拉吉夫·甘地及其家人和朋友曾乘坐航母“维拉特”号前往拉克沙群岛度假10天，把该航母当作“私人出租车”用。周四，退役高级海军军官对此予以强烈反驳。Vice Admiral Vinod Pasricha (retd), the then captain of INS Viraat, and former Navy chief Admiral L Ramdas (retd), the then the Kochi-based Southern Naval Command (SNC) chief, said Rajiv Gandhi was on board the aircraft carrier for two-three days on official duty as the PM.Moreover, no foreign nationals like Sonia Gandhi’s mother or friends of the Gandhis like film star Amitabh Bachchan ever embarked on INS Viraat, as is being alleged, added the officers.时任“维拉特”号舰长，海军中将维诺德·帕斯理查(已退役)以及时任科钦南部海军司令部司令，前海军上将 L拉姆达斯 (已退役)均表示时任总理拉吉夫·甘地当时曾在这艘航母上执行了两三天的公务。然而并没有外国人或者甘地家族的朋友登上过“维拉特”号，包括索尼娅·甘地的母亲以及电影明星阿米塔布·巴强也没登上 维拉特号航母。Vice Admiral Pasricha, however, said he had “no idea” about the vacation of Rajiv Gandhi, his family, in-laws and friends at Bangaram atoll in the Lakshwadeep archipelago, which had generated some controversy at that time for the alleged misuse of official machinery. “The vacation may have happened separately … I don’t know,” he told TOI.印度海军中将维诺德·帕斯理查对《印度时报》表示，他对拉吉夫•甘地及其家人、姻亲和朋友在拉克沙群岛班加拉姆珊瑚礁度假一事“一无所知”。“But the remarks (of PM Modi at an election rally on Wednesday) about INS Viraat being used as a personal taxi are totally wrong. Rajiv, accompanied by his wife Sonia, son Rahul and two IAS officials, did stay on board INS Viraat for two-three days. But he was on an official tour to Lakshadweep to chair a meeting of the Islands Development Authority,” said Vice Admiral Pasricha, talking to TOI.维诺德·帕斯理查告知《印度时报》：“莫迪总理在周三的选举集会上所说的将“维拉特”号航母用作私人的士的言论是完全错误的。拉吉夫在妻子索尼娅、儿子拉胡尔和两名国际原子能机构官员的陪同下，确实在“维拉特”号上停留了两三天。但他是在正式访问拉克沙群岛，主持岛屿发展局的会议。”“Rajiv, Sonia and the officials, used a helicopter to visit five-six islands to meet people and hold meetings. They would return to spend the night on INS Viraat. At no point were there any foreign nationals or visitors to the carrier. All that has been said (by PM Modi) is totally incorrect,” he added.“拉吉夫、索尼娅和官员们乘坐直升机参观了五六个岛屿，并举行了会议。他们回到“维拉特”号航母上过夜。该航母上没有任何外国公民和游客。莫迪总理所说的一切完全是错误的。”Admiral Ramdas, who also was then on board INS Viraat, in turn, issued a statement to rebut PM Modi’s claims after talking to Vice Admiral Pasricha as well Admiral Arun Prakash (retd) and Vice Admiral Madanjit Singh (retd), who were commanding warships accompanying the aircraft carrier for a fleet exercise at that time.Rajiv and Sonia had used a helicopter to embark on board INS Viraat from Thiruvananthapuram (then Trivandrum) on way to Agatti in Lakshwadeep. “There were no foreigners with them. As the flag officer commanding-in-chief of the SNC, I hosted a dinner for them on board INS Viraat. There were no other parties held on board INS Viraat or for that matter any other ship in our fleet during that time,” said Admiral Ramdas.海军上拉姆达斯当时也在“维拉特”号上,他也发表声明反驳莫迪的说法。Ramdas称：“拉吉夫和索尼娅乘坐直升飞机登上“维拉特”号，前往拉克沙群岛的阿加蒂。没有外国人和他们在一起。作为SNC总司令，我在“维拉特”号上为他们举行了晚宴。期间，我们在维拉特号上没有接待其他人。”PM Modi, incidentally, has himself embarked on aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya (INS Viraat was decommissioned in March 2017) in June 2014 and December 2015. Modi’s predecessors like Manmohan Singh and A B Vajpayee, too, have spent time on board warships as part of the naval tradition to host the “PM’s Day at Sea”.莫迪总理本人在2014年6月和2015年12月曾登上“维拉特”号航母(“维拉特”号于2017年3月退役)。莫迪的前任，如曼莫汉·辛格和瓦杰帕伊，也曾登上过该航母，举办“海上总理日”。</description>
