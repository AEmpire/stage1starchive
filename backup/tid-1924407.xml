<span>灾厄改了吧，这mod改了整个游戏流程，我记得每个原版boss之间都有灾厄的过度boss和装备，然后在它的第三个难度，也就是基于原版专家难度更进一步的灾厄复仇难度里，每个原版boss都改了AI，增加了更高的难度，还改了原版装备的效果，加了一套新的游戏机制。虽然灾厄的大头是从月总后到终灾为止的一系列灾厄boss，不过我印象最深的还是它改了AI的几个原版boss，特别是难度改的极其扭曲的石巨人。</span><br>

<span>      Characters on the player select screen will now animate when selected</span><br>
<span>      Launching the game should now automatically generate a ResourcePacks folder in your save folder for texture packs</span><br>

<span>      There is now improved UI feedback when attempting to delete favorited characters, explaining why</span><br>
<span>      The player/world menu scroll bar is removed if there are not enough saves to need scrolling</span><br>
<span>      There is now a button to instantly apply resolution changes from the menu settings</span><br>
<span>      The Death screen now has a timer until you respawn, and you can also quit out of the game while dead. Your timer will continue to tick down while on the main menu, and if you rejoin while it is still active, you will still be dead</span><br>
<span>      You can now change the eye and skin color of your character at a Dresser</span><br>
<span>      Added a setting option that allows you to toggle whether Hovering Wings work by holding down, or by pressing down once. Particularly impactful on Gamepad</span><br>
<span>      If various things happen while the game is minimized on your task bar, it will now flash. This includes things like taking damage, spawning, or worldgen finishing</span><br>
<span>      There are now icons on your map showing your world spawn and your current bed spawn point</span><br>
<span>      Player, NPC, and Boss Icons, as well as several other icons, now have a white outline on the map to increase visibility</span><br>
<span>      Added the ability to double click on the map to make a ping for other players to see</span><br>
<span>      Teammate names now display on the screen in an easier to read way</span><br>
<span>      Holding backspace in chat deletes text faster</span><br>
<span>      You can now chat/talk in single player, for using emotes or seeing past world messages</span><br>
<span>      You can now copy/paste sign text and it will include line breaks</span><br>
<span>      Quick Stack will now prioritize Piggy Banks, Safes, Defender抯 Forge, Void Vault, and the portable Money Trough and Void Bag</span><br>
<span>      The viable range when Quick Stacking to nearby chests has increased by 25%</span><br>
<span>      You can no longer place favorited Money Troughs inside of themselves</span><br>
<span>      Added a blue box under item mouseover text in the inventory to increase text readability. This feature has an option to turn it off if preferred.</span><br>
<span>      Currently selected recipe now has a gold highlight</span><br>
<span>      The currently active hotbar slot is now brighter when the inventory is open</span><br>

<span>      The default cursor now has a white outline, but you can still change this in the options</span><br>
<span>      Achievements now make a sound when unlocked</span><br>
<span>      If someone attempts to quit out of the game mid-save, the game will still attempt to finish saving, which should prevent a lot of save corruptions</span><br>
<span>      Multiplayer dedicated servers now save every 10 minutes, rather than every morning</span><br>
<span>      The dedicated server should now prevent your PC from going to sleep when inactive, which would stop the server</span><br>
<span>      A1. Gamepad Related Changes:</span><br>
<span>                Changed how Gamepad LT and RT buttons navigate through the inventory menus. They will make a complete loop if you continue pressing the same button, while previously LT and RT could each only send you to different parts of the UI</span><br>
<span>                There is now a Gamepad option in the Keybinding settings to change the speed of moving the cursor through the inventory, called 揑nterface Movement Delay?</span><br>
<span>                Added improved Gamepad button options for removing housing status for NPCs</span><br>

<span>                When utilizing the Gamepad 揢se from inventory?feature, it will use consumable items like potions or magic mirrors immediately</span><br>
<span>                Attempting to craft another item while holding the previous crafted item on Gamepad will place the first item in your inventory to free up space</span><br>
<span>                Quick Craft on Gamepad no longer crafts items as fast, to prevent it from flooding your inventory and multi-crafting items by accident</span><br>
<span>                When using Gamepad, only NPCs near the player will show their names, instead of all of them on screen</span><br>

<span>      Sunflowers now block the spread of Hallow</span><br>

<span>      The Lunar Invasion planets visible in the sky</span><br>

<span>      After this period of immunity, at least 30 seconds must pass before you can re-activate the immunity buff.</span><br>
<span>      Squire Set</span><br>

<span>      Spooky Breastplate now gives +2 Minion count instead of +1</span><br>
<span>      Spooky Leggings now give 20% movement speed</span><br>

<span>      Nebula Armor</span><br>

<span>      Solar Breastplate melee damage bonus increased from 22% to 29%</span><br>
<span>      Each piece of the set now gives 1 HP/s regen</span><br>
<span>      Instead of 30% damage reduction whenever you have charges, you now have 12% damage reduction at all times, and 20% additional damage reduction while charges are active. In practice, this is roughly equivalent to the same 30% it used to give due to how the two values are multiplied.</span><br>
<span>      Recharge time between shield charges reduced by 1 second</span><br>
<span>      Stardust Armor</span><br>
<span>      Stardust Guardian now has a more much vigorous and aggressive attack, and he will attack automatically without prompting. All resemblance to a certain anime is purely coincidental.</span><br>
<span>D. Melee Weapons:</span><br>
<span>      Shortswords</span><br>
<span>      Shortswords can now be used in all directions, not just forward</span><br>
<span>      Gold Shortsword damage increased from 11 to 12</span><br>
<span>      Flails</span><br>
<span>      Flails now have entirely new behavior, and a few different functionality modes.</span><br>
<span>      If you click and hold the mouse button, they will swing around rapidly, doing low knock back and hitting rapidly in a small circle around you.</span><br>
<span>      If you click and use them normally, you will shoot them forward similar to how they use to be used, but they will move much faster than they did before. The damage dealt is double in this mode.</span><br>
<span>      Finally, if you click while it is in midair after having shot it forward, it will drop suddenly and lay on the ground. This can be used as a stationary damaging obstacle like a Spiky Ball on enemies walking towards you.</span><br>
<span>      Some flails have had some stat tweaks to fit with this new setup, such as having slightly longer or shorter range, but generally speaking, all of them should perform better than before.</span><br>

<span>      Cobalt Sword</span><br>
<span>      Unchanged, but listing here intentionally to ensure there was no oversight. Cobalt Sword's damage was previously much higher than it should have been, but we are using it as the new baseline which the rest of the swords are being compared to.</span><br>

<span>      Use Time decreased from 20 to 8</span><br>

<span>      Is now autoswing</span><br>
<span>      Daybreak</span><br>
<span>      Technically a bug, fixed an issue where Daybreak would not spread its debuff if your attack killed the target in one hit. Now spreads the debuff to nearby enemies even if the attack kills the target in one hit</span><br>

<span>      Bone Javelin</span><br>

<span>      Now auto-fire</span><br>
<span>      Note: Despite the damage reduction, this will result in a stronger bow overall, albeit more defense-impacted than bows like Marrow. Change is primarily meant to introduce variation between the bows.</span><br>
<span>      Daedalus Stormbow</span><br>
<span>      Damage decreased from 43 to 38</span><br>
<span>      When using Holy, Unholy, Hellfire, or Jester arrows, shoots an average of 2.66 arrows, instead of the normal average of 3.33 arrows</span><br>

<span>      Now shoots 3 Piranhas, which can attack the same or different targets</span><br>
<span>      The rate at which the Piranhas can bite has been decreased slightly on an individual basis, but the total DPS the three Piranhas can do is now much higher</span><br>

<span>      Damage increased from 65 to 85</span><br>
<span>      Use Time decreased from 22 to 20</span><br>

<span>      Celebration</span><br>
<span>      Damage decreased from 65 to 25 (Note: Rocket damage is very high and is added to this. Even Rocket 1s deal 40, so the actual damage reduction is 105 to 65 even using the worst Rockets)</span><br>
<span>      Bonus Critical chance of 10% removed</span><br>
<span>      Now sold by the Party Girl after Golem</span><br>

<span>      Mana cost increased from 4 to 5</span><br>
<span>      Poison Staff</span><br>
<span>      Note: Previously, due to piercing immunity frames, only one projectile from each shot would hit each target, resulting in a lot of lost damage. We've implemented a system that allows ALL of the projectiles to hit a target, dramatically improving its shotgun-like functionality. However, to offset this gain, it has had to have some of its stats reduced. On the whole, this should now be a stronger weapon, however.</span><br>

<span>      Can now inflict critical hits</span><br>
<span>      Medusa Head - Complete Overhaul</span><br>
<span>      Rather than being charged, this weapon is now channeled and its range substantially reduced.</span><br>
<span>      When channeled, it will be held in front of the player. If no enemies are present, it will not fire, and will consume no mana.</span><br>
<span>      When enemies are in range, it will constantly attack any nearby enemies, consuming mana for each attack.</span><br>
<span>      Can hit up to 3 targets with each attack (does not consume extra mana)</span><br>
<span>      Damage is now set to 40</span><br>
<span>      Mana cost has been decreased from 18 to 15, however, it can now fire up to 4 times per second, increasing the speed at which it consumes mana</span><br>

<span>      Mana cost decreased from 25 to 19</span><br>
<span>      Tome of Infinite Wisdom</span><br>
<span>      Damage increased from 24 to 32</span><br>
<span>      Use Time decreased from 30 to 25</span><br>
<span>      Venom Staff</span><br>
<span>      Note: Has received the same general overhaul as Poison Staff. Should be much improved in actual use, but needs stat reductions to offset this change. Give it a try before you judge! :)</span><br>

<span>      Reduced number of enemies that each projectile can hit from 7 to 5</span><br>

<span>      Now has a range before projectiles die, 50% longer than Poison Staff's</span><br>
<span>      Wasp Gun</span><br>
<span>      Note: This may sound like a nerf on paper, but it trades "hit count" for total damage, and will actually result in dramatically more DPS for the Wasp Gun. Less Wasps, more damage.</span><br>
<span>      Damage increased from 21 to 31</span><br>
<span>      Use Time increased from 11 to 18</span><br>
<span>      Wasps can now bounce/pierce only 3 times instead of 4</span><br>

<span>      Mana cost increased from 11 to 15</span><br>
<span>      Staff of Earth</span><br>

<span>      Use Time decreased from 40 to 24</span><br>
<span>      Projectile speed greatly increased, as a result, has better range and much harder to fall below the minimum threshold to maintain maximum damage</span><br>
<span>      Heat Ray</span><br>
<span>      Note: There were too many "full piercing" weapons at this tier, and not enough high single target damage weapons. Heat Ray changed to avoid redundancy with Shadowbeam Staff and Staff of Earth and give the class more versatility. </span><br>
<span>      Damage increased from 55 to 80</span><br>
<span>      Use Time decreased from 16 to 10</span><br>
<span>      Can no longer pierce and hit multiple enemies</span><br>
<span>      Bat Scepter</span><br>
<span>      Average Bats per cast increased from 2 to 2.5</span><br>
<span>      Mana cost increased from 3 to 6</span><br>
<span>      Charged Blaster Cannon - Complete Overhaul</span><br>
<span>      This weapon still charges, but it now fires constantly while charging.</span><br>
<span>      For the first second of charging, you will fire 6 single-target pellets, each dealing a base damage of 100 (up from 50)</span><br>
<span>      For the next two seconds, you will fire 3 total piercing blasts, each dealing a base damage of 250 (up from 100)</span><br>
<span>      After this, it will shoot the laser beam, which is unchanged from the original implementation</span><br>
<span>      You can also quick-fire pellets without charging. The fire rate of these pellets is much higher than the previous implementation.</span><br>
<span>      The mana cost of charging is unchanged, however, quick firing will naturally consume more mana as the fire rate has increased significantly.</span><br>
<span>      Nebula Blaze</span><br>
<span>      Use Time decreased from 15 to 12</span><br>
<span>      Mana cost decreased from 18 to 12</span><br>
<span>G. Summons:</span><br>
<span>      Summoned minions now adjust their damage dynamically based on your current equipment and damage buffs</span><br>
<span>      "Some (though not all) Summons now use their own damage immunity timer system. In practice, what this means is that they will no longer interfere with the use of other weapons by maxing out the enemy's immunity frames. All affected minions are set on their own damage timer to most correctly match their pre-change DPS, but some changes are to be expected comparing 1.3.5 DPS to 1.4 DPS. In general, even if there is some minor loss or gain of DPS compared to pre-change performance, it should be worth the improvement to overall performance. Examples of minions impacted by this change:</span><br>
<span>      - Slime Staff</span><br>
<span>      - Spider Staff</span><br>
<span>      - Pirate Staff</span><br>
<span>      - Optic Staff</span><br>
<span>      - Raven Staff</span><br>

<span>      Fire Rate increased dramatically</span><br>
<span>      Raven Staff</span><br>
<span>      Damage increased from 37 to 55</span><br>
<span>      Flight speed doubled</span><br>
<span>      Rainbow Crystal Staff</span><br>
<span>      Damage decreased from 150 to 80</span><br>
<span>      Fixed accuracy issues, improved the speed at which sparkles explode. Should easily do more damage than before.</span><br>
<span>H. Ammo:</span><br>
<span>      Arrows and Thrown ranged weapons no longer have a chance to drop as items for reuse</span><br>
<span>      Bone Arrows</span><br>

<span>      Post-bounce arrows only deal 66% damage</span><br>
<span>      Holy Arrows</span><br>
<span>      Falling Stars can no longer pierce and hit a second target</span><br>
<span>      Falling Stars now do 50% of the original damage instead of 100%</span><br>

<span>      You no longer gain stacked benefits from wearing multiple Celestial Stone variants</span><br>
<span>      In addition to its previous Confusion effect, Brain of Confusion now gives a 1/6 chance to avoid enemy attacks. Upon avoiding an attack, you will gain a temporary buff that gives 20% critical chance for a few seconds, during which time you cannot avoid additional attacks.</span><br>
<span>      Titan Glove and its tinkers now give autoswing to all Melee Weapons (and Whips!)</span><br>
<span>      Wing Balance has been heavily balanced across the entirety of the game.</span><br>
<span>      With only a few exceptions, wings found at the same tier should be roughly equivalent in power. Exceptions are usually particularly hard or particularly easy to get.</span><br>
<span>      Unfortunately, its difficult to share exact stats for wings, partially because there are dozens of them that have been changed, and their stats don't easily translate to easily readable stats.</span><br>
<span>      The best short summary is that over a dozen sets of wings were buffed, and that Leaf and Frozen Wings have been reduced in power, as they were too strong for their tier.</span><br>
<span>      Other major notes:</span><br>
<span>      - Butterfly and Bee Wings can now only drop after the Mech Bosses, but their power has been increased proportionally.</span><br>
<span>      - Previously, most wings from Wall of Flesh until Golem were very similar in power, and didn't offer a lot of reason to upgrade. These have now been spread out, creating a more gradual, consistent increase in wing power across the course of the game.</span><br>
<span>      Shrimpy Truffle now gives its increased speed and damage bonus when in the rain.</span><br>
<span>      Basilisk Mount now has a double jump</span><br>

<span>      Shoot speed increased from 16 to 18</span><br>
<span>J. Tools and Mining:</span><br>
<span>      All axes, hamaxes, chainsaws and other tools with axe-functionality have their wood cutting speed increased by 20%</span><br>
<span>      All drills and chainsaws now dig faster than their non-mechanical counterparts, but have shorter range. Additionally, optimized digging loadouts still perform better on pickaxes/axes, but drills and chainsaws will be faster on non-optimized loadouts</span><br>
<span>      Desert Fossil can now be mined at any pickaxe power or with bombs. However, it is fragile and adjacent fossil blocks may break when you mine it, costing you some of the ore.</span><br>
<span>      Desert Fossil based gear is now weaker because it is available sooner.</span><br>
<span>      Hellforges now require Demonite Pickaxe or higher to break. They also now protect the tiles below them from being broken while in the Underworld. This does not apply outside of the Underworld.</span><br>
<span>      Cactus Pickaxe</span><br>
<span>      Use Time decreased from 16 to 15</span><br>

<span>      All of the Food in the game, including the 50+ new Food items, have had their durations and tiers adjusted to have a more consistent reward for the difficulty of obtaining them.

<span>      Invisibility Potion now has an added benefit of reducing enemy spawn rates by 20%</span><br>

<span>      All other sources of this debuff are intended recipients of the improved damage</span><br>
<span>      Venom Debuff</span><br>
<span>      Damage per second increased from 12 to 30 on both player and enemy versions of the debuff</span><br>
<span>      Pygmy and Queen Spider Staff Venom duration decreased to mitigate the increased potency</span><br>
<span>      Black Recluse and Sand Poacher Venom duration decreased somewhat to mitigate the increased danger to the player</span><br>
