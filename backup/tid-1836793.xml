Two officials with the U.S. Department of Energy labeled America's natural gas to match the country's reputation for freedom in a https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-authorizes-additional-lng-exports-freeport-lng%22,%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22%7D]press release this week. Its new name? "Freedom gas."
&#13;
The announcement on Tuesday shared the department's approval of additional exports of liquified natural gas produced by a Freeport LNG facility on Quintana Island, Texas. 
&#13;
"Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America's allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy," said Mark W. Menezes, the under secretary of energy.
&#13;
Steven Winberg, assistant secretary for fossil energy, added to the patriotic terminology by calling the natural gas "molecules of U.S. freedom."
&#13;
"With the U.S. in another year of record-setting natural gas production, I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of U.S. freedom to be exported to the world," Winberg said.</description>
