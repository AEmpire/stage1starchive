&#13;
巴纳拉斯印度大学（ Banaras Hindu University BHU）将于明年 1 月开始为期 6 个月的新课程，教授医生们如何治疗那些声称自己看到鬼或被鬼附身的人。BHU 的工作人员告诉印度亚洲通讯社（Indo-Asian News Service IANS）记者，他们已经成立了一个独立的 Bhoot Vidya（鬼魂研究）单位，将关注一些常与超自然现象混淆的心理疾病。
&#13;
该课程将由阿育吠陀（Ayurveda，意思为生命的科学，是一种古老的印度医学）的教职工指导。阿育吠陀疗法一般包括草药、饮食改变、按摩、呼吸或其他形式的运动。在课程中，医生们将被教授使用阿育吠陀疗法治疗鬼魂相关疾病。
&#13;
2017 年，世界卫生组织（WHO）估计，约 20% 的印度人患上过抑郁症。但在这个拥有 13 亿人口的国家，只有不到 4000 名精神卫生专业人员，而且人们对这类问题知之甚少。由于普遍存在的耻辱感，很少有人寻找专业的帮助，许多在农村和贫困地区的印度人，常会选择拜访巫师和巫医，希望他们能治愈自己的精神疾病。BHU 开设新课程的消息在社交媒体上遭到质疑，一些人指出，现代医学和适当的康复治疗才是处理心理健康问题更适合的方法。

Bhoot Vidya: India university to teach doctors Ghost Studies
&#13;
A prestigious Indian university is offering a certificate course to teach doctors how to treat people who claim to see or be possessed by ghosts.
&#13;
The six-month course at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in the northern city of Varanasi will start in January.
&#13;
Officials say it will focus on psychosomatic disorders which are often confused with paranormal occurrences.
&#13;
The course will be conducted by the faculty of Ayurveda, the ancient Hindu system of medicine and healing.
&#13;
A BHU official told news agency IANS that a separate unit of Bhoot Vidya (Ghost Studies) had been set up in the university.
&#13;
    The Indian woman who hunts the witch hunters
&#13;
    The only people willing to take Delhi's 'most haunted house'
&#13;
    Why we should believe in ghosts
&#13;
"Bhoot Vidya mainly deals with psychosomatic disorders, diseases caused by unknown reasons and diseases of mind or psychic conditions," Yamini Bhushan Tripathi, the Ayurveda faculty dean, said.
&#13;
She added that the university was the first in the country to offer such a course which would teach doctors about "the Ayurvedic remedies to treat ghost-related ailments".
&#13;
Ayurvedic therapies generally include herbal medicines, diet changes, massages, breathing and other forms of exercise.
&#13;
According to a 2016 study by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience (Nimhans), nearly 14% of Indians are mentally ill. And in 2017, the WHO estimated that 20% of Indians might suffer from depression at some point in their lives.
&#13;
But there are less than 4,000 mental health professionals in the country of 1.3 billion people and there is little awareness about these issues.
&#13;
Also, because of widespread social stigma, few seek for professional help or care and many Indians, especially in rural and poorer areas, visit shamans and witch-doctors in the hope that they will help cure their mental illnesses.
