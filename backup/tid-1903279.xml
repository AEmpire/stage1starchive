      <description>以色列研究发现：植物被伤害时会用超声波表达痛苦&#13;
12 月 2 日，一项发表在 bioRxiv 上的研究（尚未进行周全的同行评审）发现：植物在缺水或者遭受身体伤害时可以发声表达自己的痛苦。
&#13;
科学界早就发现植物可以在被昆虫触碰时作出反应，会转向光源，能 “闻” 出其他植物的存在，有个别的甚至对麻醉剂敏感，暗示着它们有可能会体验到类似于痛苦的感觉。但它们痛苦了之后会叫可是完全的 “next level shit”。由以色列特拉维夫大学植物科学家 Itzhak Khait 领导的团队在距番茄和烟草植物十厘米处，放置了能够检测超声波频率的麦克风，然后停止给它们浇水，剥去它们的茎干。
&#13;
声波的测量范围在 20 至 150 赫兹之间。探究者们发现，即使是快乐、健康的植物也会偶尔发出声音。但当被切割时，烟草植物在一个小时内平均发出 15 次声音，番茄植物发出 25 次。10 天不浇水会让烟草植物每小时发出 11 次声音，而番茄植物会叫 35 次。
&#13;
这些 “尖叫” 都在人耳能听到的范围之外，但是可以听到超声波的生物（例如老鼠，蝙蝠或其他植物）可以从四五米远的地方听到植物的悲惨呻吟。植物在不同刺激下发出的叫声次数不一样，这也让科学家怀疑它们存在某种类似语言的系统。

论文摘要：
&#13;
Stressed plants show altered phenotypes, including changes in color, smell, and shape. Yet, the possibility that plants emit airborne sounds when stressed – similarly to many animals – has not been investigated. Here we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that stressed plants emit airborne sounds that can be recorded remotely, both in acoustic chambers and in greenhouses. We recorded ∼65 dBSPL ultrasonic sounds 10 cm from tomato and tobacco plants, implying that these sounds could be detected by some organisms from up to several meters away. We developed machine learning models that were capable of distinguishing between plant sounds and general noises, and identifying the condition of the plants – dry, cut, or intact – based solely on the emitted sounds. Our results suggest that animals, humans, and possibly even other plants, could use sounds emitted by a plant to gain information about the plant’s condition. More investigation on plant bioacoustics in general and on sound emission in plants in particular may open new avenues for understanding plants and their interactions with the environment, and it may also have a significant impact on agriculture.

Plants emit remotely-detectable ultrasounds under stress.(a) Acoustic box setup. In each recording, three plants are placed inside an acoustic box with two directional microphones oriented at each plant. Using two microphones helps eliminating false detections resulting from electrical noise clicks of the recording system and cross-plant interference. (b) Mean number of sounds emitted during 60 minutes of recording by tomato and tobacco plants under two treatments, drought stress and cutting. Three control groups were used – empty pots, and two groups of untreated plants: self-control – the same plant before treatment, and neighbor-control – untreated plants that shared the acoustic box with treated plants. All treatment groups emitted significantly more sounds (p&lt;e-6, Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction) than all control groups: self-control (Meanself−control &lt; 1 for all plant-treatment combinations) and neighbor control (Meanneighbor−control &lt; 1 for all plant-treatment combinations). The system did not record any sound from pots without plants during the experiments (Meanpots = 0). 20 ≤ n ≤ 30 plants for each group. (c) Examples of time signals of sounds emitted by: a drought-stressed tomato, a drought-stressed tobacco, a cut tomato, and a cut tobacco. (d) The spectra of the sounds from (c).https://pic-1251685093.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Bed/F2.large.jpgPlant condition and species can be detected from a distance by listening to its sound emissions.(a) The recorded sounds intensity peak and the max energy frequency for the four groups – drought stressed tomato plants, cut tomato plants, drought stressed tobacco plants and cut tobacco plants. (b) The accuracy of sound classification achieved by different feature extraction methods, with an SVM classifier. The best results were obtained using the scattering network method for feature extraction (red line, p &lt; e-12 for each pair). Using MFCC for feature extraction the results were also highly significant (black dashed line, p&lt;e-4 for each pair) and even basic methods for feature extraction allowed for better-than-random classification (gray line, p&lt;e-6 for each pair apart from one case: Tobacco dry vs. Tobacco cut, which was bot significant with the basic method). The comparisons Tomato vs Elect. Noise and Tobacco vs Elect. Noise related to electrical noise of the system. Training set size of the two groups in each pair was equal (400 &lt; sounds for each pair, see Table S2), and significance levels for each pair were calculated using Wilcoxon rank sum test with Holm–Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.https://pic-1251685093.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/Bed/F3.large.jpgAcoustic detection of plant condition in the greenhouse. (a) Illustration of the procedure used to train a classifier that distinguishes between tomato sounds and greenhouse noises.A greenhouse noises library was first generated, by recording inside an empty greenhouse for several days. Using this library and the library of tomato sounds recorded in an acoustic box, we trained a convolution neural network (CNN) classifier to distinguish between tomato sounds and greenhouse noises. (b) Illustration of the recordings in the greenhouse. Tomato plants were recorded in the greenhouse. The recorded sounds were filtered using the trained CNN classifier, leaving only the tomato-classified sounds. (c) Confusion matrix showing the success of the trained CNN classifier in distinguishing between tomato sounds and greenhouse noises. Balanced accuracy score of ∼99.7%. (d) Confusion matrix showing the success in distinguishing between dry tomato plants and irrigated tomato plants, based on one hour of recording inside a greenhouse. The condition of the plant (dry / irrigated) was here decided based on the number of recorded tomato-classified sounds: if above three the plant was classified as “dry”, and otherwise as “irrigated”. Balanced accuracy score of ∼84% (p&lt;e-5; Fisher exact test). (e) The number of tomato-classified sounds per day during dehydration. Tomato plants (N = 21) were recorded in the greenhouse for ten consecutive days without watering (starting one day after watering). The recorded sounds were then filtered using the trained CNN classifier, leaving only the tomato-classified sounds. We find significant difference in the amount of sounds between the following consecutive days: 1-2 and 2-3 (Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests, corrected for 9 comparisons between pairs of consecutive days using Holm-Bonferroni method; The ‘*’ markings in the figure represent adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05).

<span>人要是听得见这些超声波，甭管是噪音还是信号都是一种反应，对植物的食用文化应该会和现在很不一样，很多民族可能会从超声反应出发，诞生出源于植物形象的神灵、恶魔、灵魂类传说文化。崇尚不杀生类的宗教，教义该改了吧。君子远庖厨的庖厨，可能连切菜剁萝卜捣蒜也算三远离、三不闻了</span><br>
