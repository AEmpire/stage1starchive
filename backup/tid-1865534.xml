ign：
&#13;
剑盾 9.3：Pokemon Sword and Shield are the best games in the series, streamlining its most tedious traditions without losing any of the charm
&#13;
ds 6.8：There is a fascinating, fleshed-out world of supernatural science fiction to enjoy across its sprawling and spectacular map, so it’s a real shame that it’s all been saddled on a gameplay backbone that struggles to adequately support its weight over the full course of the journey.
&#13;
gs:
&#13;
剑盾 9：In collecting, battling, and exploring, Sword and Shield cut out the bloat and focus on what makes these pillars of the Pokemon games so captivating in the first place. You're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pokemon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way. This leaves you free to enjoy what Pokemon is all about, and that makes for an incredibly strong showing for the series' proper debut on Switch.
&#13;
ds 9：Death Stranding is a hard game to absorb. There are many intertwining threads to its plot, and silly names, corny moments, and heavy exposition belie an otherwise very simple message. That comes through much more clearly in the game's more mundane moments, when you find a desperately-needed ladder left behind by another player or receive a letter from an NPC thanking you for your efforts. It's positive without ignoring pain; in fact, it argues in both its story and its gameplay that adversity itself is what makes things worth doing and life worth living. It's a game that requires patience, compassion, and love, and it's also one we really need right now.
&#13;
egm：
&#13;
剑盾 80：The first new-generation Pokémon game to release on a proper home console does not disappoint. New features like Dynamaxing and the Wild Area are fun additions that make the experience of becoming a Pokémon champion still feel fresh. It’s just a shame that Game Freak didn’t lean into the new features more than they did
&#13;
ds 100：No matter what you end up thinking of it, Death Stranding is a work that can truly claim to be something different in a time of overwhelming sameness
&#13;
usg：
&#13;
剑盾（尚未出分？）：Honestly, since I'm being forced to choose over a real next-gen Pokemon experience or no Pokemon at all? I'll take it. I've enjoyed my time with Sword and Shield a lot so far, even if it's lacking in huge surprises.
&#13;
ds 70：Death Stranding might be Kojima's boldest game to date. It may also be his most tedious. Either way, its originality outweighs its sometimes exhausting structure and poor pacing... but only just. Maybe not a game I would recommend to everyone, but certainly one of the most interesting games of 2019.
&#13;
gi：
&#13;
剑盾 8.75：Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield deliver a new generation of creatures to capture throughout a consistently enjoyable adventure.
&#13;
ds 7：The game bears the unmistakable mark of its creator, but doesn't leave enough for players to enjoy.
&#13;
polygon：（不打分）
&#13;
剑盾：The surprise in Sword and Shield is that I’m still finding things that surprise me, even after putting in so many hours. It’s in how Game Freak has made a linear game feel so much less linear. Make no mistake, Sword and Shield is not an open-world game. There are limitations. But the game’s designed for me not to notice them, and mostly, I don’t.
&#13;
ds：Death Stranding feels like two games in one, designed for seemingly opposite audiences. One is a wholly unique open-world adventure with asynchronous cooperative multiplayer that allows me to feel like I’m part of a community, building a world from scratch. And the other is a long, confusing, deeply strange movie. The former is pulling most of the weight, but they share equal screen time. And, like a steamer trunk full of sperm, it’s impossible to separate the good from the bad. It’s all in the same box.
&#13;
gamesradar：
&#13;
剑盾 90：Gameplay tweaks and attention to detail make Pokemon Sword and Shield the most compelling Pokemon world to date.
&#13;
ds 70：AN OKAY GAME IRONICALLY LOST IN ITS LENGTHY DELIVERY
&#13;
vg247:
&#13;
剑盾 60：Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield is all too often a bit disappointing, and in some places actually feels a little unfinished, but it also fully provides that warm, fuzzy feeling that one expects from the series. Crucially, even through frustration, never once did I think about putting it down, which is to its credit.
&#13;
ds 60：If you do manage to hold out, you will be rewarded with flashes of brilliance, it’s just that those flashes are buried as deep as the core story is buried in the endless dialogue.
&#13;
daily star：
&#13;
剑盾 60：Pokémon Sword and Shield are not bad games.But fun character arcs and inventive, creative designs of new ‘mon are oftenoffset by poor pacing and restrictive world design.
&#13;
ds 100：Death Stranding is the most uniquebig-budget game I’ve ever played, a socially-minded injection of inventiveideas into a genre that has long survived by being lazy and brutish. Thisambitious formula-flipper is brimming with empathy and carefully courtscinematic influences, an ensemble cast and a world of eye-watering scale,delivering a sticky gameplay loop to tie it all together and create a consolegeneration-defining experience.</description>
