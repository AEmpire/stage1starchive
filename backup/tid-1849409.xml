      <description>sadpanda 关了吗&#13;
我去
&#13;
昨天半夜修好变砖的平板（此过程之辛苦就不提了），今天果断安好VIEWer，各种解析失败
&#13;
谷歌一下出来这个
&#13;
说的已经很隐晦了，不懂的人都不知道我说的啥
&#13;
但不会这么巧吧，就今天刚安装好APP，你告我今天就关了？？

Exhentai - Don't Ever Forget
&#13;
After twelve years, Exhentai has closed its doors. The owner says he closed the site because of a Dutch anti-loli law kicking him off his host. He suffers from an injury that makes sitting in front of a computer difficult, and isn't willing to hunt for hosts that will protect him from DMCA claims and anti-loli laws. Users were given about 12 hours notice so they could back up as much as possible. Even with more time, a full site rip would be impractical because just the raw image files are about 50TB. Exhentai was home to much more than porn. You could find countless obscure art books, CGs from artists who erased their own internet presence, and many more rare oddities. The sad panda mascot is an icon of an older internet sensibility, which stood for exclusivity and lurking more. Its death is another nail in the coffin of this sensibility, which has long been declining in favor of accessibility.</description>
