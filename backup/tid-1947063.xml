      <description>黑泽明之鬼&#13;
Jason Connell and Nate Fox, the creative directors behind Ghost of Tsushima, are very upfront about the influence legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa had on their open-world samurai game.
&#13;
"I think one that is just crystal clear is the movie Sanjuro," Fox tells EW of the 1963 work. "It's a film that features, at the very end of it, a standoff between two samurai. The tension that those two warriors have, they wait for the other to make a first move and then one of them dies with just one stroke of his sword. We tried to translate that into the standoff in our game very directly." Another he points to is Kurosawa's 1954 classic Seven Samurai, "which defines my concept of what a samurai is," Fox remarks. "The samurai in that film have a dignity and a heart that we really strived to capture."
&#13;
Connell, Fox, and their team at Sucker Punch, which developed Ghost of Tsushima after the inFamous series, pulled from a long list of inspirations for their next saga, about a lone samurai who must betray his noble principles in order to save his home from invading Mongols. We're talking everything from Japanese comics like Usagi Yojimbo to other games like 1984's Karateka. But the influence of Kurosawa's work is so strong that they decided to honor the director, who died in 1998, with something called Kurosawa Mode.
&#13;
Prospective players caught a glimpse of this gaming format during May's virtual State of Play preview presentation. It's the black-and-white cinematic mode that mirrors Kurosawa's filmmaking style and aims to give gamers the feeling of playing inside a samurai movie. Connell and Fox pitched the concept to Kurosawa's estate to get the official blessing.
&#13;
"We have this great game that transports people back to feudal Japan and Akira Kurosawa was one of our reference guides, especially early on about how we wanted it to feel," Connell explains. "As we got closer and closer to making that a reality, we were like, 'What do we call this special mode that we created, this black-and-white throwback?' We threw out a bunch of different words and we thought, 'What would be awesome would be if we could call it Kurosawa Mode.' In order to do that, we felt that we needed to reach out to the estate and see if that's something they'd be interested in. We sent a short video showing what it generally looks like, what it feels like."
&#13;
It's not just a black-and-white filter, Connell clarifies. "We actually did some research on the curves that may have existed on that kind of film that  might've used."
&#13;
It proved difficult to translate that directly into a game like Ghost of Tsushima with current film-mapping technology, so Connell took various black-and-white samurai films and **yzed scenes from various times of day and weather conditions to track "how deep were the blacks? How bright were the whites?"
&#13;
For final touches, the team added a film grain to make the mode appear as though it had just emerged from the age of Kurosawa, as well as an increased wind function. In Ghost of Tsushima, the wind serves as the player's navigational tool; Jin actually follows the wind to find his next destination. In the Kurosawa Mode, the wind is "cranked up," says Connell. "And lastly," he adds, "we actually toyed with the audio a little bit. Our audio team have an internal tool that mimicked sounds of old TV and, specifically, megaphones, radios, TVs back to the '50s." It all makes for a game with the feel of theatrical entertainment.

<span>具体要怎么操作……类似骑砍或者荣耀战魂那种吗</span><br>
<span>我倒是挺喜欢装甲恶鬼村正里面那种剑术讲解式的战斗，不过那是小说……动作游戏怎么搞这种</span><br>
<span>还是单纯学黑泽明那种在现代看来很怀旧的风格好一点</span><br>

<span>架势、体力细分，架势还能再细分成格挡方位、局部体力、肢体惯性等等</span><br>

<span>日本剑道里面有个词叫“攻め”，大概就是通过调整自己身体的重心来保持一个进攻的架势从而给对手造成心理上的压力。包括之前看一些日本电影和日本小说，他们剑客对峙的时候都有很多“心理战”一样的描写:对决双方会详细评估对手的架势，推断他会怎么出招，然后由此来决定自己怎么出招。在此之上就可以有“假架势”“出刀后变招”等一系列精彩操作。</span><br>
<span>不知道这个在游戏里有没有方法去提现。</span><br>

<span>这种做成ACT目前感觉还是太复杂，衍生出的变化可能比现有格斗游戏还复杂，</span><br>
<span>我觉得可以考虑先出一个类似半自动依赖AI的策略系统（FF12那种gambit），各种AI选项组合成复杂的应对策略，快速反应也交给AI，ACT苦手的玩家一样可以玩</span><br>

<span>猜拳比重高了其实就类似荣誉战魂了，我的想法还是猜拳比例低，更注重近战的【连续对策】，最终结果一般是一个个小的决策累计出来的，而不太会是一两次大决策决定的。</span><br>
<span>例如 if 对手XX构、敌我距离XX、敌武器长度XX、敌XX攻击起手、我方XX构、我方武器长度XX ----> then 我方 进入XX构、保持敌我距离XX、专注区域XX、采取XX行动。 </span><br>
<span>当然还要包括 交剑之后一些临场的变化脚本，例如进攻被格挡后马上回撤残心或格挡XX区域，还是连续进攻等等。</span><br>
