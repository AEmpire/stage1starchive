      <description>美男高中生因拒打水痘疫苗起诉卫生部门后感染水痘&#13;
https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/health/chickenpox-lawsuit-vaccine-teen-illness-trnd/index.html(CNN)Two months after going to court over a chickenpox policy, an unvaccinated teen came down with the illness, his lawyer said Wednesday.（西恩恩报道）据其律师星期三所称：在因拒打水痘疫苗出庭起诉卫生部后两个月，这名少年不幸感染水痘
&#13;
Jerome Kunkel sued the local health department because of a policy temporarily barring students who aren't immune against chickenpox from coming to classes and extracurricular activities at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart/Assumption Academy in Walton, Kentucky.
&#13;
The high school senior refused the vaccine, citing his faith. Kunkel's father, Bill, told CNN affiliate WLWT they object to the particular vaccine because he believed it was derived from "aborted fetuses."
&#13;
The chickenpox vaccine was created using cells descended from those of a fetus terminated in the early 1960s.因当地卫生部门的法令限制未打疫苗的学生上课和参加课外活动，高中生杰弱母·康口愤而起诉本地卫生部门。
&#13;
杰弱母·康口先生因信仰原因拒打疫苗。他的父亲比尔告诉记者他们拒绝接种某些特定疫苗，因为他认为这些疫苗由‘堕胎’而来。
&#13;
在上世纪60年代，水痘疫苗主要以从流产胚胎所制。
&#13;
Kunkel contracted chickenpox last week and has recovered, his attorney Christopher Wiest told CNN by phone Wednesday. Kunkel went back to school on Wednesday.
&#13;
"Jerome is in a catch-up mode," Wiest said. "He feels like they kind of ruined his senior year."
&#13;
Kunkel has been out of school since mid-March, Wiest said.
&#13;
Wiest says Kunkel is “fine” and “a little itchy.”据其律师克里斯托弗·韦斯特所称，康口自从三月中旬起离开学校，他于上周身患水痘，现已痊愈，已经于星期三返回学校上课。“杰弱母很努力追上进度，但是他觉得是学校的规定影响了他的毕业学期学习。他现在很好，就是有些痒。“
&#13;
The Northern Kentucky Health Department announced a policy in March after a chickenpox outbreak affected 32 people, which is 13% of the student body, at the school. Students who weren't vaccinated, or were not immune, were asked to stay out of school for at least 21 days after the last case of the virus, the health department said.
&#13;
Kunkel filed the lawsuit over the health department's decision, especially because it affected his basketball season.
&#13;
"The fact that I can't finish my senior year of basketball, like our last couple games is pretty devastating. I mean you go through four years of high school playing basketball, but you look forward to your senior year," he told CNN affiliate WLWT in March.
&#13;
None of the basketball team members were vaccinated for chickenpox, the school's principal had told a health official, according to the judge's ruling obtained by CNN affiliate WXIX.
&#13;
Only 18% of the school's students are fully vaccinated, a school official told the local health department北肯塔基于3月发生一场水痘爆发，影响32人，其中13%是在校学生。当地卫生部在爆发后发布规定：要求未进行疫苗注射或免疫的学生学校出现感染病例后离校至少21天。
&#13;
受规定影响，康口起诉卫生部。在3月他告诉记者“这政策让我没办法完成最后一年的篮球赛季。我们前几场比赛已经很惨了。你知道，尽管你在高中打了4年篮球，最后一年还是最关键的“
&#13;
而据校长称：学校篮球队的成员没有一人进行过水痘疫苗的注射。该校学生中也仅仅有18%完成了全部疫苗的免疫。
&#13;
A Kentucky judge rejected Kunkel's request to prevent the health department from enforcing its school and activities ban in April.
&#13;
Kunkel's attorney said preventing the students from going to school fell short of containing the illness.
&#13;
"Their ban didn't stop these kids from going to church together," Wiest said Wednesday. "Their ban is going to be ineffective from the start. The quickest way to get them back to school is to get it naturally."肯塔基法官在4月裁定：驳回康口的起诉，支持卫生部的禁令。
&#13;
康口的律师称相关禁令对预防传染于事无补。“这些孩子只是不能一起上学，但是他们还是一起去教堂。这个禁令从一开始就毫无卵用，要让他们回到学校最好最快的办法就是顺其自然。”
&#13;
The Northern Kentucky Health Department expressed concern over Wiest's comments about students contracting the virus so they may become immune.
&#13;
"Encouraging the spread of an acute infectious disease in a community demonstrates a callous disregard for the health and safety of friends, family, neighbors, and unsuspecting members of the general public," the department said in a statement Wednesday. "A person who has contracted chickenpox can be infectious for up to 2 days before experiencing the rash that is associated with the virus."
&#13;
Barring students from attending school and after-school activities can help prevent the spread of the disease. They "are designed to prevent unvaccinated people who have been exposed to the virus from infecting members of the general public while they are infectious," the statement said.
&#13;
The health department also worried that the comments may be downplaying the severity of the dangers of the chickenpox virus, which is known as varicella.
&#13;
Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease that causes a blister-like rash, itching, fever and tiredness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus spreads by contact with infected individuals.
&#13;
The CDC recommends against people intentionally exposing children to chickenpox in hope that they get the disease.北肯塔基卫生部对律师的此番言论表示担忧。在星期三卫生部对此做出公告“鼓励一种传染病在社区中传播是对朋友、家人、邻居和公众社会的一种不负责任的行为。水痘感染者在出现皮疹症状前两天就可能变得极具传染性。阻止感染学生参与校内和课后活动能有效遏制疾病的传播，这是为了避免未免疫群体暴露在传染源之下并感染疾病的必要措施。“
&#13;
卫生部也对某些淡化水痘危险的言论表示担忧。
&#13;
根据美国疾控中心CDC的资料，水痘是一种高度传染性疾病，可能造成皮疹、瘙痒、发热、疲劳，这种病毒由接触传播。CDC反对有意让儿童接触水痘的行为。（译者注：指Pox party，某些家长认为儿童对疾病有着更强的抵抗力，在儿时感染疾病的损害低于成年后再感染。而水痘感染后终身免疫，所以将儿童聚集并暴露给传染者作为疫苗免疫的替代）
&#13;
When asked if Kunkel regretted not getting vaccinated, Wiest said, "These are people of deep and abiding faith, of strong religious beliefs. At no point in time do they regret not getting vaccinated."
&#13;
"They believe this is the right cause. They regret what the health department did."当被问起康口是否后悔当初应当接种疫苗时，韦斯特律师说“有些人有着强而有力，强而有力呀的信仰。他们绝对不会后悔接受疫苗。他们认为自己的作为是正确的，他们不为自己的行为感到后悔，而只是对卫生部的政策抱有遗憾。”</description>

<span>为什么这个反智行为贯彻得这么彻底？全校只有18%打疫苗……</span><br>
<span>18%是全免疫，绝对不接种任何疫苗的也是有的，但是大部分是因为各种各样的原因而拒打某些特定种类的疫苗，但是能接受其他种类的疫苗。</span><br>
<span>比如我之前认识一个商科生，可能是看了什么百度百科之类的野鸡生物豆知识，他对疫苗的判断就是灭活可以打，减毒绝对不打；</span><br>
<span>有的人因为对鸡蛋过敏而拒绝接种用鸡蛋生产的疫苗（比如流感疫苗）——尽管这类疫苗都有无鸡蛋替代品，但是他们“为了保险起见“而拒绝接种；</span><br>
<span>最后就是像文中的水痘疫苗，或者我学过的风疹疫苗例子（来自上世纪澳大利亚科学家设计的WI-38细胞，源自一个流产胚胎的肺细胞），使用人类组织生产的，违反某些人的宗教忌讳。</span><br>
<span>还有一些人是一种自私心态：大家都接种了就有了群体免疫，我不打也无所谓。反之如果疫苗有问题，是别人去得病我又没事——他们蠢就蠢在这种念头藏得越深越好，出来宣传让社会的接种率降低只会让群体免疫效果下降甚至消失。</span><br>
