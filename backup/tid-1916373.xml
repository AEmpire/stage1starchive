&#13;
据CNN新闻网2月26日消息，美国食品药品监管局（FDA）局长史蒂夫·哈恩于当地时间2月25日表示，“我们正密切关注疫情爆发对美国医疗物资供应链所造成的的影响。这包括，美国的关键医疗物资有可能被断供，甚至出现严重的短缺。”
&#13;
　　该部门表示，美国有约20种药物（或其原材料），只能在中国获得。
&#13;
　　“我们正在和那些可能会受到原料短缺影响的公司取得联系，目前还没有公司遇到这个情况，”美国食品药品监管局发言人表示，“我们会继续和制造商们保持联系，向其提供必要的帮助，从而解决潜在的问题。”
&#13;
　　美国对中国的原料药有很大依赖程度。
&#13;
　　美国食品药品监管局曾在2019年7月31日向美中经济安全审查委员会汇报，2018年各国向美国出口药品贸易量中，中国排名第二，占13.4%。中国出口美国的医疗物资中，有83%为成型制剂（如片剂、针剂、胶囊等），7.5%为原料药，还有约10%用于动物治疗。而整体来看，全球22%的原料药和14%的成型制剂，都产于中国。
&#13;
As I have previously communicated, the FDA has been closely monitoring the supply chain with the expectation that the COVID-19 outbreak would likely impact the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to supply or shortages of critical medical products in the U.S.
&#13;
A manufacturer has alerted us to a shortage of a human drug that was recently added to the drug shortages list. The manufacturer just notified us that this shortage is related to a site affected by coronavirus. The shortage is due to an issue with manufacturing of an active pharmaceutical ingredient used in the drug. It is important to note that there are other alternatives that can be used by patients. We are working with the manufacturer as well as other manufacturers to mitigate the shortage. We will do everything possible to mitigate the shortage.
&#13;
Additional Information on Human Drugs
&#13;
Since January 24, the FDA has been in touch with more than 180 manufacturers of human drugs, not only to remind them of applicable legal requirements for notifying the FDA of any anticipated supply disruptions, but also asking them to evaluate their entire supply chain, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (the main ingredient in the drug and part that produces the intended effects, e.g., acetaminophen) and other components manufactured in China.
&#13;
Also, as part of our efforts, the FDA has identified about 20 other drugs, which solely source their active pharmaceutical ingredients or finished drug products from China. We have been in contact with those firms to assess whether they face any drug shortage risks due to the outbreak. None of these firms have reported any shortage to date. Also, these drugs are considered non-critical drugs.
&#13;
We will remain in contact with manufacturers so that we can continue to assist them with any potential issues in the fastest way.
&#13;
The FDA says it has determined there are 20 products for which the ingredients, or the finished product, are sourced entirely from China, but makers say so far there has been no interruption in their supply. The FDA said these drugs also are “considered non-critical drugs.” 
&#13;
Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal in a note said his team also has been taking the temperature of the industry about supply chains. In discussions with four industry execs, they were told that no shortages have yet materialized, but if the situation continues “spot shortages” will pop up late in the second or third quarter. Bernstein says they were told the industry has six to nine months of supplies split among suppliers, generics makers and distributors.
&#13;
Prices of “key starting materials," however, are starting to rise, up 10% to 50% depending on who is asked, and generics producers are beginning to look to their clients to absorb those increases, Bernstein reported. He said Indian generics producers are “better backward integrated than the US players" and they will withstand shortages better. 
&#13;
One key player in generics and off-patent antibiotics is holding the line on some prices. Novartis’ Sandoz unit yesterday pledged “stable” pricing for certain essential drugs and antibiotics amid the crisis. Antibiotics are particularly vulnerable to price raises since China dominates ingredients in that area. 
&#13;
Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread globally. The World Health Organization says cases were reported in “nine new member states” with the global case count now at 82,104, with 2,801 deaths reported.

<span>同理，想到以前那些鼓吹在海外种粮食的</span><br>
<span>所以国家在推土豆主粮化，这玩意最高亩产9.5吨/年 ，平均2吨/年。优化一下育种估计可以做到平均亩产万斤。</span><br>
