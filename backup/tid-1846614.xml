      <description>床破：I'm with him&#13;
VOX报道：https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/7/12/20691739/acosta-resigns-stepping-down-trump-jeffrey-epstein
&#13;
Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta announced his resignation Friday morning, but President Trump is still defending him.
&#13;
现任美国劳工部长亚历克斯·阿科斯塔于本周日上午宣布辞职，然而大统领床破依然在捍卫他。
&#13;
“This was him, not me,” Trump told reporters on Friday of Acosta’s decision to resign. “I’m with him.”
&#13;
“（辞职）是他的决定，可不是我的决定。不过我与他共进退。“床破这样告诉记者。//有趣的是I'm with her是2016年希拉里阵营的口号
&#13;
Acosta is stepping down amid growing criticism of a non-prosecution agreement his office signed with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2008, when Acosta was US attorney for Miami. Under the deal, Epstein served just 13 months in a county jail, even though he was accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls.
&#13;
阿科斯塔近日因2008年杰弗里·爱泼斯坦性侵案被重新关注而获得批评，进而辞职。爱泼斯坦案发时阿科斯塔任迈阿密检察官。他在未经当事人同意的前提之下私自与爱泼斯坦达成认罪协议而不决定起诉。尽管他被控性侵数十名未成年少女，在认罪协议之下爱泼斯坦仅仅在县监狱关押了13个月。
&#13;
Criticism of the deal has been growing since Epstein was arrested this week on new sex trafficking charges. But on Friday, Trump defended the deal, saying Acosta “made a deal that people were happy with, and then 12 years later, they’re not happy with it.” The president’s words were a reminder of a longstanding pattern: Throughout his administration, he’s defended men like Epstein who are accused of harming women.
&#13;
在本周爱泼斯坦再次因与未成年少女性【交易】而被捕后，他2008年的认罪交易被再度发掘出来。然而在星期五，床破出面为当年的协议说话，称阿科斯塔“当年做成了一个人人都满意的协议，然后过了12年，大家又都不满意了”。床破的话让人们再次认识到：在他执政期间，他总是为像爱泼斯坦这种伤害女性的杂碎辩护。
&#13;
Critics on the left and right have been calling for Acosta to resign since last November, when Julie K. Brown of the Miami Herald reported on his role in the Epstein non-prosecution agreement.
&#13;
早在去年11月，Miami Herald报社记者Julie K. Brown抖出阿科斯塔在爱泼斯坦一案中的角色时，左右两翼就有批评要求阿科斯塔下台。
&#13;
Earlier this week, though, Trump defended Acosta, saying he felt “very badly” for the labor secretary amid the criticism he faced, “because I’ve known him as being somebody that works so hard and has done such a good job.”
&#13;
然而本周床破却为阿科斯塔说情，表示他对阿科斯塔所受的这些言论‘非常担心’，称“因为我很了解他，这个认真负责的他，这个努力工作的他，这个成绩斐然的他。”
&#13;
Trump also said, “if you go back and look at everybody else’s decisions, whether it’s a U.S. attorney, or an assistant U.S. attorney or a judge, if you go back 12 or 15 years ago or 20 years ago and look at their past decisions, I would think you would probably find that they would wish they’d maybe did it a different way.”
&#13;
床破称“你回去翻翻资料，12、15或者20年前的，不论是公诉人还是助理检察官，甚至是法官的判决和协议，我觉得你都会想这里能有个更好的判决/协议”
&#13;
His remarks on Friday struck a similar tone. Acosta was “not a good labor secretary, a great labor secretary,” Trump said. “He’s done a fantastic job.”
&#13;
床破用一副很熟的语气说阿科斯塔是“作为劳工部长不算一流，是超一流。他干的相当不错“
&#13;
By contrast, the president has distanced himself from Epstein. In the past, he had socialized with the money manager, praising him as a “terrific guy” and joking “it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”
&#13;
相比之下，床破刻意与爱泼斯坦划清界限。在过去他曾于爱泼斯坦社交互动过，赞扬爱泼斯坦是个‘猛男’，还开玩笑称‘（爱泼斯坦是猛男）特别体现在他和我一样喜欢美女，而且还都是年纪小的美少女’
&#13;
This week, however, Trump said that the two went their separate ways 15 years ago. “I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,” he said, according to the Associated Press.
&#13;
然而本周床破却称他们两个在15年前便分道扬镳了。”我就告诉你一点：我从来也不是他的朋友“床破对记者说。
&#13;
Still, his defenses of the deal that allowed Epstein to stay out of prison — and the man in charge of brokering that deal — are a reminder that Trump has routinely defended men accused of harming women.
&#13;
床破的话让人们再次认识到：在他执政期间，他总是为像爱泼斯坦这种伤害女性的杂碎辩护。//换了一套句法和措辞，但是大致也是这个意思
&#13;
When White House staff secretary Rob Porter resigned after being accused of abuse by two ex-wives, for instance, Trump said, “we hope he has a wonderful career and he will have a great career ahead of him.”
&#13;
在白宫秘书罗伯特·波特因被指控虐待两位前妻而辞职时，床破立即站出来说“我们希望他在白宫做的愉快，也祝愿他未来光明。”
&#13;
The president added that Porter was “very sad” about the allegations against him, and said, “we absolutely wish him well, he did a very good job while he was at the White House.”
&#13;
床破称波特对施加于他的指控‘很伤心’，称‘我们当然希望他好啦！他在白宫工作时干的很不错。’
&#13;
Trump also routinely defended Brett Kavanaugh, now a US Supreme Court justice, after Christine Blasey Ford said that he had sexually assaulted her when the two were in high school.
&#13;
床破甚至经常捍卫布雷特·卡瓦诺。卡瓦诺现任美国最高法院大法官，克里斯汀·布莱西·福特称在他们还是高中生时卡瓦诺性侵了她。
&#13;
“A man’s life is in tatters,” Trump said of the allegation against Kavanaugh. “A man’s life is shattered.”
&#13;
“一个男人的生活被毁了，被流言蜚语打得千疮百孔。”床破对此评论道。
&#13;
The president also mocked Ford at a rally before an audience of thousands, poking fun at the fact that she couldn’t remember certain details of the incident she described.
&#13;
床破甚至在几千人参加的拉力中恶意模仿福特，戏谑地重现她不能描述案发细节的场景。
&#13;
“What neighborhood was it? I don’t know,” he said. “Where’s the house? I don’t know. Upstairs? Downstairs? Where was it — I don’t know. But I had one beer, that’s the only thing I remember.”
&#13;
“（性侵）发生在哪个街区？我母鸡啊～哪间屋子？我母鸡呀～楼上还是楼下，到底是哪啊？我全都母鸡啊～但是我就记得我那天喝了杯啤酒”
&#13;
Acosta himself is not accused of any sexual misconduct. Still, Trump’s words in defense of him were a reminder that when women speak up about violence, assault, and abuse, it’s often the men involved for whom Trump expresses the most sympathy.
&#13;
阿科斯塔自身并为被控任何性犯罪，然而床破维护他的话语再次让人们意识到：当女性因遭受暴力、侵犯和虐待挺身而出作出指控时，像床破这样的人总是会优先对那些侵犯者表示同情。</description>

<span>那个案子真实性存疑</span><br>
<span>找到的唯一英文报道是美联社的：https://www.apnews.com/4d72284784e3e3353459248dec2984b5</span><br>
<span>上面提到的和目前流传较广的中文报道不符的地方有：</span><br>
<span>1. 当事人并不是单身父亲，而是与妻子住在一起，有4名子女；</span><br>
<span>2. 案件并不是发生在志愿者上门带走孩子时，而是在警察来调查性侵指控时；</span><br>
<span>3. 当事人并非持刀与警方对峙，而是用.22口径拳铳先击伤了一名警官，然后在交火中被击毙；</span><br>
<span>不论事实如何，这都不是什么“当年轰动全美”的案子</span><br>
