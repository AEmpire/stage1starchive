日本要对韩国执行经济制裁。日本政府将于7月1日宣布，从7月4日起，日本半导体材料、OLED材料等将限制对韩国出口。奥维睿沃（AVC revo）总经理助理梁龙颜认为，日本限制关键材料出口韩国，波及韩国两大核心产业——面板和半导体，将影响SDC、LGD、SK海力士、三星半导体等韩国企业的相关业务，对韩国经济产生重大的影响。

&#13;
 日本限制出口韩国的三种材料分别是TV、 智能手机面板上使用的Fluorine Polyimide、半导体制作过程中的核心材料光刻胶，以及Eatching Gas( 高纯度半导体用氟化氢）。
&#13;
 这是日本对韩国的反制措施之一。去年10月，日本制铁(原新日铁住金)公司接到韩国最高法院关于向韩国“二战”劳工进行赔偿的终审判决，该判决让日本制铁公司高层“感到非常遗憾”。因为韩国政府坚持由日韩两国企业自愿出资向被征劳工进行支付。而日本政府要求按照1965年《日韩请求权协定》设置仲裁委员会。当时日本就表示，“将视日韩两国政府间的外交谈判状况，采取恰当应对”。
&#13;
 据韩国媒体报道，日韩政府高层在G20峰会上又针对“二战”劳工赔偿事件进行了谈判，但是双方没有谈拢，导致日本采取对韩国出口限制的措施。接下来，日本公司在向韩国出口物品时需要获得日本政府相关部门的许可。
&#13;
 日本基本垄断了氟聚酰亚胺、氟化氢市场。据了解，日本占全球氟聚酰亚胺总产量的90%，全球半导体企业70%的氟化氢都从日本进口。因此，当日本对韩国进行出口管制时，韩国面板企业和半导体企业必须寻找另一个进口国家。如果韩国不能及时寻找到替代进口国家将直接对韩国显示半导体产业产生重大影响，同时也将波及三星、LG的客户——苹果、谷歌、华为、OPPO、vivo、索尼等。

Samsung, LG brace for Japan's economic sanctions 
&#13;
By Jun Ji-hye
&#13;
Samsung, LG and other IT companies are keeping a close watch on possible Japanese economic sanctions amid a deepening diplomatic row between the two nations over forced labor during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of Korea, officials said Sunday.
&#13;
Japan's conservative daily Sankei Shimbun reported earlier in the day that the Japanese government plans to impose economic sanctions on Korea beginning this month in protest at the ruling of Korea's Supreme Court last year that Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi, must pay compensation to individual Korean victims of wartime forced labor.
&#13;
The newspaper said the Japanese government will implement stricter restrictions on exports of three items ― fluorine-containing polyimide, resists and etching gas ― to Korea on July 4. 
&#13;
Fluorine-containing polyimide is used to make displays for TVs and smartphones, while resists and etching gas are necessary in the semiconductor fabrication process.
&#13;
Samsung Electronics, SK hynix, LG Electronics and other large companies here are expected to be affected if Japan implements the sanctions. 
&#13;
"We will need to watch what announcement the Japanese government will make, but if the press report was correct, it would exert adverse influence on the nation's semiconductor and display industries in the long term," said a company official, who declined to be named.
&#13;
Another official at a semiconductor maker said Korean companies have stocks of materials necessary to manufacture products in the short term, but if the sanctions are implemented, there would be production delays in the long term.
&#13;
"There are a lot of concerns as Korean companies have imported a considerable quantity of materials from Japan for semiconductor fabrication," the official said. 
&#13;
According to the Sankei Shimbun, the Japanese government has decided to exclude Korea from a list of "white countries." 
&#13;
The Japanese government exempts exporters from needing permits when exporting the high-tech materials to 27 "white countries," including the United States and the United Kingdom. Japan designated Korea as a white country in 2004. 
&#13;
If Korea is excluded from the list, Japanese companies will need to apply for permits whenever exporting fluorine-containing polyimide, resists and etching gas to Korean companies from July 4. 
&#13;
It reportedly takes about 90 days for Japanese authorities to examine and approve applications.
&#13;
Japanese companies have about 90 percent of the global fluorine-containing polyimide and resists market, while it has 70 percent of the etching gas market. 
&#13;
If the sanctions are implanted, Korean companies will need to find alternative sources for the materials, officials said. 
&#13;
But another official in the semiconductor industry said: "Korean companies are major clients of Japanese companies, thus it will not be easy for the Japanese government to make a decision as the sanctions will also adversary affect Japanese companies' profitability."
&#13;
Amid diplomatic rows, President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did not meet on the sidelines of the G20 that started Friday in Japan. 
&#13;
Japan will reportedly announce its decision on the export controls Monday.</description>
