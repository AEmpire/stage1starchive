看样子角色不少，至少有两个女游击队员，一个孩子，加上之前的三个，六个往上稳了。

Partisans is a real-time tactical strategy dedicated to partisans during World War 2. This game is about soviet partisans and their activity during World war II. It’s focused on harsh reality in those times, when many people became reluctant heroes, and every feat required its price, and sometimes this price was extremely high.

Release date: TBD

ABOUT GAME
&#13;
Partisans is a real-time tactical strategy with non-linear type of storytelling. This game is about soviet partisans and their activity during World war II. It’s focused on harsh reality in those times, when many people became reluctant heroes, and every feat required its price, and sometimes this price was extremely high.
&#13;
The game shows the war from a new, poorly explored angle. However, it is not a historical simulator, Partisans offers a unique interpretation of those times’ events. The game shows partisans’ everyday life, which is full of cold, hunger and wounds. Still there is a room for joy as well. Players would have to make tough choices, for example, they’ll have to decide whether to help civilians and betray their position or to walk past and stay unnoticed. The game give opportunities to prove oneself in a fight, to overcome the superior forces of the enemy using cunning and mother wit , and to leave the field when the situation is really bad.
&#13;
TACTICS
&#13;
Partisan war is a sabotage war. Forget about open fights, that are usual in games about World War II, in which a lone ranger breaks through thousands of enemies. Discover a multifaceted tactical game in which intelligence, patience and caution get the win. Explore the territory, plan attacks, avoid detecting and deal fatal strikes on the enemies’ superior forces.
&#13;
CHARACTERS
&#13;
You’ll have to become the commander of partisans, to lead a squad and to form the relations system. The main character finds himself in the rear of German troops and gathers a squad of local residents and the surviving Red Army’s soldiers. Complicated moral choices and problems with discipline in the squad – all these things are part of the commander’s everyday life. Your squad will consist of more than 10 characters, each with a unique biography and personality. Among them are trained soldiers and ordinary people from cities and villages, who lost their home and family because of war.
&#13;
METAGAME
&#13;
The game combines several modes: real-time missions, base management and strategic campaign management. In strategic mode you’ll have to open new areas on the global map, send the partisans for scouting and select missions for the squad. Some locations are must, they will lead you through the main plotline. However exploring hidden areas can help you to get random missions that could also affect the squad’s story.
&#13;
GAME WORLD
&#13;
Game events occur mainly in Pskov oblast and cover the fall of 1941 and the beginning of 1942. You will get in a historical military setting with a description of that time’s events — realistic enough to be truthful. This is the other side of the war, much less known than front-line battles.
&#13;
The plotline does not reflect the life of any particular person, but it is based on what could happen in reality — in this very place and at this very time. Characters have real prototypes, and events take place in recognisable landscapes, but the story leaves opportunities for fiction.
&#13;
COMBAT SYSTEM
&#13;
In the battle there often is an opportunity to go right through, but partisans prefer sabotage war. Therefore, stealth mode will be the most advantageous in confrontation with superior enemy forces. Besides, each partisan in the game is unique and has several active skills. Tactical break allows players to combine actions and plan the battle beforehand.
&#13;
Select characters for missions carefully, taking into account their characteristics, develop your battle strategy using shelters, diversion maneuvers and other ways to eliminate enemies.
&#13;
VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
&#13;
Environmental conditions will not let you relax: raids take place throughout the day and night in any weather. However don’t be afraid to go the enemy territory at night or when it’s raining as changing conditions affect your enemies, making them less attentive and more vulnerable. Environmental conditions can mix and overlap.
&#13;
Partisans’ story takes place during several seasons with different weather conditions. So missions may differ, and the correct choice of squad members and accurate planning can be really important.
&#13;
THE BASE
&#13;
You need to build your own camp for effective recreation and developing your squad. There all the partisans will gather and listen your commands, there they will be treated after the battle and prepare for new missions. Also in the base you will be able to take your time and improve your weapon in relaxed atmosphere or to discuss with the squad completed tasks or to chat with others.
&#13;
The base also has a warehouse, where you can keep weapons and supplies received in missions, and areas for production of various tools and explosives that will be useful to you in battles.

<span>问题是英雄连2是加拿大人的，放原苏联国家谁也得玩明粉暗黑那套东西。至于波罗的海与乌克兰今天的表现就是沙俄/苏联地缘政治最终玩砸后，交杂着革命失败后寻找反革命时代的“闪光点”，然后意识形态化的一种必然，复杂程度相比大陆对港台间的关系很难说哪个更复杂，至于皈依者狂热，中国的体/制/民族主义对俄罗斯的那种亲昵恐怕也只是彼此彼此吧</span><br>

<span>据说英雄连2的编剧是个波兰人😄，也是，英雄连2这剧情哪怕是对苏联没有好感的人也看不惯，有人戏称“这剧情也只有波兰人能玩的津津有味了”。</span><br>

<span>嗯，只要有正常三观的人都不会对纳粹有好感吧，更何况在纳粹的种族理论中斯拉夫人也就比犹太人好了那么一点点，而西乌的极右翼却去粉纳粹，甚至在联合国大会上为纳粹分子翻案，这种行为谁看了都反感</span><br>
<span>至于那位美女检察长，不过就是一帮脑残颜控而已，我对她的看法就是路，如果他单纯骂列宁我对她的看法还是路，但她骂到太祖头上我就真的路转黑了，因为虽然我不同意她对列宁的看法，但我是外国人也不能对他国历史说三道四，但检察长毫不了解的情况下骂太祖是什么意思？她对太祖了解多少，自从她爆出那事以后我曾经回帖说“看来‘正义’的外表永远比不过正义的思想”</span><br>

<span>回到正题上，游戏重新把盟军2的包袱系统整出来加上根据方格数量携带武器与物资的传统设定复活大好评</span><br>
<span>导入等 ...</span><br>
<span>RTT给技能树系统很容易造成单位能力过强直接破局吧</span><br>

<span>检察长的问题是你批你们民族的某人粉你们民族的某人都没关系，我虽然不同意（我本人认为列宁杀光尼二全家真是太棒了，不愧是无产阶级革命领袖啊），但毕竟是你们国家的事，我作为外国人也不便多说什么，但你没事黑到太祖头上干嘛！</span><br>

<span>至少是一个非常好的点子</span><br>
<span>我不觉得会有单位强力直接破局的隐患，因为这是一个游击队题材的RTT，意味着你我只能依赖有限的兵力布置局部战术来消灭德寇完成任务，完全没法像铁血联盟或幽浮那样利用各种邪道手段刷装备刷等级，游戏制作组显然也会采用限制单一任务中出现敌人数量来控制升级速度</span><br>

<span>我觉得潜入类游戏最该做突破的地方是保持游戏性的前提下解决敌人的小聋瞎问题。不然真的感觉挺傻的。</span><br>

<span>人类对于“敌情”的判断是暧昧的，做成游戏无论ai进行了多么复杂的运算呈现出来之后都是警戒有时松有时严，这样的游戏你思考思考诟病的人比现在多还是少？</span><br>
<span>以及写实潜入的黑夜关卡如果按真实光照来玩家也看不清，玩家视角不按真实来那看起来敌军一样是瞎子</span><br>
<span>以上还都没有考虑到游戏关卡的设计空间、难度曲线等重中之重</span><br>

<span>情报落后了，这两天沉迷于Desperados3...</span><br>
<span>和同期发售的DESPERADOS相比画面上不是一个风格，西部的美术效果更精细，东欧更粗犷。类型上来说也不是传统的以潜入为主，实打实要和德国鬼子作战。</span><br>
<span>子弹看起来多，命中率能有七八分之一就不错了…开打前先找掩体…在战场上倒也差不多。两个教学关第一关以潜行为主，第二关以战斗为主。地图上除了弹药补给还能搜到些零件食物什么的，看来有点罗宾汉壮大基地的意思。</span><br>
<span>总体来讲感觉还是有点糙，不知道能打磨成什么样。说是有20关以上加8个角色。先出的队长、少年和中士技能树太困了没细看……</span><br>

<span>更接近盟二的那种玩法</span><br>

<span>盟二也就个别关卡有强制战斗啊，拯救大兵史密斯那关那样的防御战</span><br>
<span>游击队员感觉不强杀不行，德军小队就堵在必经之路上，目前看不出有无声通过的办法</span><br>
