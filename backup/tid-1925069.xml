      <description>gamstat:最终幻想7 remake三日玩家数为230万&#13;
统计日期至4月12日
&#13;
With these numbers, FFVII Remake is currently performing twice as fast as Final Fantasy XV (on PS4) was at the same time period and has 500k more players than Kingdom Hearts 3 (on PS4) did at the same time as well (note that KH3 launched early in Japan and thus its nubmers are not exactly representing 3 day tracking)
&#13;
Final Fantasy VII Remake has the third most players for 3 day trackign period for PS4 exclusives, only behind God of War (2.4M) and Spider-Man (3M).
&#13;
Also should be mentioned that the game has been sold in apparently extremely limited physical supply in many places, which might have hurt the potential sales on launch.</description>

<span>这个数据其实不大靠谱，比如我玩《战神（2018）》，打完第一个BOSS以后觉得没劲，第二天借给另外一个朋友玩了，他把游戏打通关了。在这个网站算两个玩家，因为我和我朋友都拿到了奖杯，但是游戏只卖出了一份。</span><br>
