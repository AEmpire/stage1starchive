      <description>RWBY第六季BD附赠制作花絮/补充设定总结&#13;
原文地址：https://randomuniverses.tumblr.com/post/186014505719/rwby-volume-6-crew-commentary-notesRWBY Volume 6 Crew Commentary Notes!I just got the Volume 6 Blu Ray and I’mgoing to be watching the crew’s commentary! Kerry was talking with a few othersas well as Miles after chapter 1. I wrote what I found interesting orimportant:Chapter 1:They took out the blood at the White FangHeadquarters but had to add it back in laterThe train station was the first new set ofthe seasonThey used Houdini for crowd shots thisseasonShowing what’s in the bag RWBY got for Yangis planned for next seasonOn each boba cup lid (from the food in thebackground of the train station scene) has the RWBY chibi charactersOriginally they planned Ilia to wear akimono. Also a hint to seeing her again!Kerry’s mom wants him (Neptune) to be inthe show moreThe whole train set is a circle trackThe Grimm manticore design was from anartist from the RWBY subreddit! Kerry saw it and he loved it and he contactedher to hire her.There was an inside joke for the audio teamwhere Dee dies it sounds like the track says “Oh Dee…”Dee and Dudley barely graduated from theiracademyThere was originally going to be a closershot of Salem in the OP but they wanted to keep the mystery about who she was第一集：制作组一开始删掉了白牙总部的血迹但又加回去了。火车站是这季第一个做的新场景。他们用Houdini（3D电影特效制作软件）来做人群背景。RWBY给Yang的礼品包的东西会在下季展现。每个boba杯盖上（火车站背景的食物里）是RWBY chibi角色。原定让Ilia穿和服。并暗示她以后还会出场。Kerry（导演）的妈想让Neptune（也是Kerry配音）多出现。整个火车组是圆轨迹。蝎狮戮兽manticore的设计是源自reddit RWBY板块粉丝设计！Kerry看见后很喜欢就把作者诏安了。音效组有个内部笑话，当Dee死时听起来像音轨在说“Oh Dee…”Dee 和 Dudley勉强从学院毕业。本来想给OP添加Salem的近镜头但他们想保留Salem的真实身份。Chapter 2:They put in some lines from the house (whatNora says) that were a response to the criticism from Volume 5 about themstaying there too longNora was originally going to tell Blakeeverything she needed to know with some whiteboards on the train, but theydecided to just show the house where things are explainedThe footsteps in the snow were made usingnulls in After Effects. They explain the process which is pretty interesting.Oscar struggling was done in mocapLil Miss Malachite is an allusion forLittle Miss Muffett (duh) and turns out she is the mother of the MalachiteTwinsThe Malachite Twins went to live in Valeand be bad guysJinn’s hair is separated/split more than anormal character’s. Same with Summer Rose第二集他们在房间里放了些台词（Nora说的）来回应第五季被批评在房间里待太久说太多。原定让Nora在火车上向Blake解释（第五季的事），不过他们决定还是用房间那段。雪中足迹是用After Effects（影视特效编辑软件）的空值做的，他们说这过程很有趣。Oscar的挣扎是动捕。Lil Miss Malachite是围巾小姐（LittleMiss Muffett）的暗示，而且她是Malachite Twins（Yang角色短篇里夜店两女打手）的母亲。Malachite姐妹去了Vale当坏人。Jinn的头发比一般角色分叉多，就像SummerRose一样。Chapter 3:Salem’s story one of the first things everwritten for RWBYThey really wanted a character’s story torevolve around ‘happily ever after’ then a few steps after that, so Salem wasthe perfect character for thatOriginally the Lost Fable was chapter 3 and4, but they combined them into oneThe whole episode was mocapped in a singleweekendThe crew has a Ruby body pillow prototypethat’s used during mocapThe Gods are inspired from the Gods ofGreek MythologyThey want to show more natural wildlife inRWBY, but due to budget constraints it’s hardThe video game Brutal Legend inspired thescene where Salem throws herself into the pool of GrimmOriginally the Gods were closer to humansize but were scaled upThe story structure for the episode tookinspiration from Harry Potter and Game of ThronesOriginally there was going to be moredialogue from the main cast, but they decided against itThey were originally had Salem look likeher current form (well coloring wise), but decided to remove the red veins shehas so she looked less spookyThe toy dog one of the children has is aWizard of Oz referenceJinn was meant to be an objective outsideobserver but also a storytellerThe children for one of Oz’s reincarnationshave silver eyes (confirmed)第三集Salem的故事是整个RWBY第一个所写的故事。他们也很想角色的结局停留在‘happily ever after’，这样Salem就是完美的角色了。原定让这集的内容用第三集第四集展现，但还是整合成一集了。一个周末就完成了全集的动捕。剧组有一个Ruby等身枕头模型在动捕中使用。光暗神由希腊神话启发。本想在RWBY展现更多野生动物，但预算不允许。Salem投身戮兽池受游戏Brutal Legend启发。原定让神接近人类尺寸但还是让他们比例放大了。这集的故事结构受哈利波特和权游启发。原定让RWBY有更多对话，但还是去掉了。原定让Salem长成现在的模样（布满静脉），但还是去掉了这样就不那么吓人了。玩具狗是绿野仙踪梗。Jinn注定是个客观观察者和叙述者。有的Oz转生体留下的后代中有银瞳（我觉得意思是Oz曾经附身成银瞳者或转生体与银瞳伴侣留有后代）Chapter 4:They were excited to explore Qrow’salcoholism past it just being a jokeHazel is the most compassionate of thevillainsSalem knows how to manipulate people andhas different methods for motivations for each of her lieutenantsFor example she doesn’t have to say thatmany mean things for Tyrian to take it to heart because he is so loyalShe also knows just how fearful Emerald isof her第四集他们很兴奋能展现Qrow的酒鬼过往而不只是玩笑。Hazel是这些反派里最有同情心的。Salem精于操控他人，用不同的手段来激励不同的手下。比如说她不必对Tyrian说太多，因为他那么忠诚。她也知道Emerald很怕她。Chapter 5:Neo has begun to evolve her semblance, asshown in the fightNeo wasn’t originally planned to be in thisVolume, but was decided when they thought of what they could do better to makeCinder’s storyline better and for when Cinder gets to Atlas they thought herhaving a partner was coolBrunswick Farm was another idea they hadsince the very beginningThe Apathy fit so well in this volumebecause the characters are at a low pointBlake doesn’t always get the nuances ofrelationships and makes a misstep (when Yang and Blake talked and she told Yangshe would protect her)第五集Neo开始发展她的外向力，就像打斗中展现的。Neo原本不打算出现在这季，但他们想着如果让Cinder的故事线更好并让Cinder的旅途有伴会很酷。Brunswick Farm（暴风雪山庄篇）是RWBY非常早期构思的主意（据Miles推特所说是写第一季时想到的）Apathy戮兽完美贴合这一季角色们的低落状态。Blake并不总是能意识到细微关系变化并因此失策（比如和Yang交谈时说她会保护Yang）Chapter 6:The Apathy came from an image of a horrifyingscarecrow and they came up with the idea of a grimm that wasn’t physicallyformidable. As well as a planet from the movie Serenity where everyone fell tosleep and died, and a short story about depression and not wanting to doanythingThe Apathy work through proximity but ifthey see you their effect gets even worse. But you can get it jolted out of theapathy for a little while if you are startledThe artist that made the Apathy was thesame one that made the ManticoreMaria is colorblind, which was evident inthe episode when we learn she couldn’t tell Ruby’s eye color immediatelySeeing the burning Apathy, Qrow realizesthat he almost let everyone get killed and now starts to hate himself (hisdepression changes)第六集Apathy形象源自恐怖稻草人而他们当时想塑造一个物理上并不强大的戮兽。以及《萤火虫》电影《宁静号》中的米兰达星（被投放一种消除压力的物质，所有人什么都不想做就慢慢死去了）Apathy只要靠近就会受影响，如果被看到就更糟糕。但突然受惊可以短暂脱离影响Apathy和Manticore是同一个被诏安的人设计的。Maria色盲。当看到燃烧的Apathy，Qrow意识到他几乎差点让所有人送死，并开始怨恨自己。Chapter 7:Them having a restriction for how longfights could be (because fights are expensive) led to Miles thinking of a fightthat had to last 60 seconds (and Tock)Maria’s weapon and use of dust was inspiredfrom the God of War reboot as well as Marvel’s ThorMaria was originally from Volume 5 but theyhad to take her out because it was hard to balance out all the storylinesOriginally Maria was going to have a cat,and Qrow was supposed to find her in his search for HunstmanThe Arc siblings are all a color of therainbow, with one set of twins. Saphron is orange.The toy Adrien is playing with isforeshadowing to the plane and the Leviathan第七集对打戏长度有着严格控制（因为贵）使得Miles想到一场只有60秒的战斗（以及Tock其人）Maria的武器和尘晶运用受战神游戏和漫威雷神启发。Maria原定在第五季出场，但因为无法平衡故事线而作罢。原定让Maria有只猫，而Qrow会在（第五季时）寻找猎人时遇到她。Jaune家的姐妹们都是用彩虹颜色命名的，有一队双胞胎。Saphron是橙色（而Jaune是黄色）Adren玩的玩具是结局飞机与Leviathan戮兽伏笔。Chapter 8:Only Cordovin’s guards are so goofy(compared to the rest of Atlas guards), and Cordo is considered a nuisance.This was a job they thought she could do well without bothering anyoneKerry wanted an old lady fight in the show,so he got oneThe Old Lady in the Show was somethingMonty thought of. The boot is the foot of a giant mech. And the giant mech wasoriginally going to be at the end of V2Butterflies are normally not out in thewinter but this is Remnant ;)第八集只有Cordovin的卫兵才那么愚蠢（相比其他Atlas卫兵），而Cordo被认为是麻烦精。这是一个被认为可以让她好好完成而不烦任何人的工作。Kerry希望有个老妪开飞机的场景，现在他有了。这老太婆（Cordovin）是Monty Oum以前想到的。这巨型机甲的一只脚是靴子。而这机甲原定出现于第二季结尾。蝴蝶通常不会在冬天看到但毕竟这是Remnant。   Chapter 9:Miles likes to think of Tyrian as one ofthe most insightful villains. He is really good at observing people and knowshow to take them apart mentally and physicallyThis is where they said this is the firsttime we see Mercury and Emerald being vulnerable to each other (I didn’tinclude this earlier, sorry!)They say they’ll never confirm who the RedHaired Woman is, but they said use your brains lolLooking up at Pyrrha and seeing the airshipfly by made Jaune think of the idea to steal one第九集Miles把Tyrian看做最有洞察力的反派之一。他善于观察他人并知道怎样在心理上身体是摧毁对方这是第一次我们能看到Mercury和Emerald彼此如此脆弱。他们永远不会告诉你那个Pyrrha雕塑前的红发女人是谁，但叫你自己思考233.看着Pyrrha顶上飞过的飞机给了Jaune去偷一架的灵感Chapter 10:Adrian’s crying is not a semblance, that’sjust comedyThey pitched Jaune’s voice down when hesays “Roger” so he can sound more seriousOriginally there was going to be anotherepisode (episode 14t) where we would see Atlas and Mantle. But they didn’t wantto end on that because it would require a ton of new assets because of thebuildings and the people wearing different clothesThe next season will start with a bangThe Iron Giant was a reference for the mech第十集Adrian的哭声不是外向力，只是喜剧效果。Jaune说“Roger”时他们把Jaune的声音调低这样能听起来严肃些。原本的14集会让我们看到Atlas和Mantle（Atlas和Mantle的关系见四大王国设定篇Atlas篇）。但这样会极大增加工作量和新设定新建模所以作罢//其实就是被gen:LOCK压资源了（笑）下一季开头会搞大事情（Neath Oum早就暗示过来原定第六季结局要搞的大事情改到第七季）Cordo的机甲是对《铁巨人》的致敬Chapter 11:The mech fight was the most effects-heavyof the fights this seasonBlake has always had the scar on her bodysince the new outfit, but it has been hard to see until her jacket comes offYang hitting Adam with her bike was thoughtof early on in the scripting process第十一集机甲战是本季用特效最多的战斗。Blake的第三季后模型一直在身体上有疤，但非常难看到，直到外套被脱下。Yang用大黄蜂撞Adam的情节他们预谋很久了。Chapter 12:A lot of talk about how the animations weremade and suchThis season had a core fight team thatanimated all the fightsThe way Adam dies is apparently similar tohow something in Nier: Automata plays out. Kerry has only played an hour of thegame so he did not know that was a thingBut Nier: Automata was actually referencedfor the mech fight (the mechanics of how the fight would work) since a robotwas involved in the first boss fight.Shots from the Adam and Yang fight weresimilar to those from Naurto, but that was also a coincidenceThey called the Leviathan Levi in thescript because it was easier to type第十二集这季有着专门用来做打斗动画的队伍制作了所有的打戏。Adam的死法很像尼尔机械纪元的情节。Kerry只玩了一小时所以他真的不知道这回事。但机甲战确实致敬了尼尔机械纪元。Chapter 13:They considered Adrian being a very youngbaby, but later changed him to be a toddlerGurren Laggan was another reference usedfor this part (haven’t seen that anime but it was referenced when the mechdrills the Leviathan)They really wanted to make sure we couldhear liquid in Qrow’s flaskSalem is no longer willing to confineherself to a room, and is going to start being more active by creating her armyof minions第十三集原定让Adiran是个年幼的孩子，但还是改成了学步婴儿。钻头致敬了天元突破//天元突破是当年Mo逼着Miles&amp;Kerry看的第一批番制作组真的确保我们能听见Qrow酒瓶里的液体。Salem再也不愿只呆在那房间，她将开始更加活跃并制造她的大军。</description>
