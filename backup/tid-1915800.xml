其中有一个简单易行的建议：如果你不想让塑料垃圾流进海洋，最简单的做法就是把它们扔进普通垃圾箱，而不是可回收垃圾箱，否则它们大概率会在几周或几个月后漂浮在东南亚的某片海面上。
&#13;
Some plastic discarded on land does end up in the ocean, but very little of it comes from consumers in the United States or Europe. Most of the labels on the plastic packaging analyzed in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch came from Asia, the greatest source of what researchers call “mismanaged waste.” Of the plastic carried into oceans by rivers, a 2017 study in Nature Communications estimated, 86 percent comes from Asia and virtually all the rest from Africa and South America. Developing countries don’t yet have good systems for collecting and processing waste, so some of it is simply dumped into or near rivers, and these countries’ primitive processing facilities let plastic leak into waterways.
&#13;
When you recycle plastic, you prevent it from polluting the oceans. This myth is based on the enduring delusion that plastic from curbside bins can be efficiently turned into other products. But sorting the stuff is so onerous and labor-intensive—and the resulting materials of so little value—that recycling plastic is hopelessly unprofitable in the United States and Europe. Municipalities expected to make money selling their plastic waste to local recyclers, but instead they’ve had to pay to get rid of it, mostly by shipping it to Asian countries with low labor costs. The chief destination for many years was China; but two years ago, China banned most imports, so the plastic waste has been diverted to countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
&#13;
That means that some of the plastic from your recycling bin has probably ended up in the ocean because it has gone to a country with a high rate of “mismanaged waste.” At the rudimentary recycling plants in Asia, some of the plastic waste leaks out into the environment, and much of the imported waste doesn’t even reach a legitimate recycling plant. Journalists and environmentalists have been collecting horror stories in Malaysia and Indonesia of Western plastics piling up at illegal dumps and spewing toxins when they’re burned in backyard kitchens. The people living near the dumps and recycling operations complain that foreign plastics are fouling their air and polluting their rivers.
&#13;
回收再利用这项事业根本无利可图，只好出口到第 三 世 界 国家，中途跑冒滴漏或者根本到不了目的地，还是对海洋造成污染

</p><p><b>本异末同: </b><br>
<span>但根据生活经验，没有利用价值的东西不会有人付钱，而废旧塑料是有人花钱回收的。</span><br>
</p><p><b>Cray: </b><br>
<span>市面上一堆回收料做的塑料品 …</span><br>
<span>----发送自 Sony H8296,Android 9</span><br>
</p><p><b>石越: </b><br>
<span>怎么可能没用啊。</span><br>
<span>要真没用哪来那么多人捡pet瓶子？</span><br>
</p><p><b>badmouse: </b><br>
<span>本来就应该算到环保成本里。</span><br>
</p><p><b>nosmokingspp: </b><br>
<span>搞不好你天天吃的外卖快餐盒就是回收塑料做的</span><br>
</p><p><b>点点杠: </b><br>
<span>欧美人真的挺恶心的，但是垃圾分析为什么大部分来自亚洲</span><br>
</p><p><b>kerorokun: </b><br>
<span>塑料也要分的，可乐瓶子之类的回收使用率其实不低的，重灾区还是塑料袋包装袋这种轻薄塑料</span><br>
</p><p><b>EP2: </b><br>
<span>二料，了解一下</span><br>
</p><p><b>活久见: </b><br>
<span>塑料的种类多了，是不是傻哦</span><br>
</p><p><b>千墨云烟: </b><br>
<span>有回报。现在衡量一下回报不足了。自然就禁了</span><br>
</p><p><b>六等星: </b><br>
<span>现在很多衣服都是回收材料做的了。</span><br>
</p><p><b>菲特妹: </b><br>
<span>在发达国家的确是个笑话</span><br>
<span>处理这些垃圾浪费钱，还不如做做样子，直接卖到**</span><br>
<span>还能拿zf的环保补贴，一鱼两吃</span><br>
<span>国民有自信，大家都装瞎，谁也不说破</span><br>
</p><p><b>sdhgak1234: </b><br>
<span>很多人行道的地砖似乎是用回收塑料做的</span><br>

</p><p><b>手撕寿司: </b><br>
<span>欧美国家和我国情况完全不同。</span><br>
<span>举个例子：我们会进口美国废报纸，打浆后印刷我们的报纸</span><br>
<span>他们国家的回收成本太高了，本来在我们这里很正常的回收产业在欧美国家完全经济上不合算。</span><br>
