TAIPEI, Taiwan, October 9, 2019
&#13;
ASUS, a leading server system, server motherboard, workstation and workstation motherboard provider, today announced that the ASUS RS500A-E10-RS12U server with 2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ 7742 processors achieved the highest scores across multiple benchmarks for compute-intensive applications, according to the latest results released on September 18, 2019 by the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC). 
&#13;
These new scores represent another impressive achievement in leadership server performance for ASUS since recently setting a total of 246 world records for the fastest 1P and 2P server performance. These achievements across multiple platforms demonstrate that ASUS servers are an ideal, highly scalable choice for infrastructure visualization, data analysis, AI training workloads and compute-intensive applications.
