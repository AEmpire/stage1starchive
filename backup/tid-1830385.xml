Trump says deal with China is still possible, but tariffs are an 'excellent' alternative
&#13;
President Donald Trump on Thursday said he has an "excellent" alternative to a possible trade deal with China, as Chinese officials are set to meet U.S. trade negotiators later in the evening in Washington.
&#13;
"Our alternative is an excellent one," Trump told reporters at the White House.
&#13;
Asked if he would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said, "Well, he just wrote me a beautiful letter, I just received it, and I'll probably speak to him by phone."
