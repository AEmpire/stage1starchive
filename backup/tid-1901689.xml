      <description>人民的呼声：IGN玩家选出年度最佳游戏——死亡搁浅&#13;

Few games this year divided IGN's staff - and players in general - more than Death Stranding. That was evident in the wide range of critical reviews of the game, our own staff's perspective, and even in our People's Choice awards polling. While Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order and Resident Evil 2 were close runners-up, enough Death Stranding players preferred Kojima's Snake-free take on the apocalypse that it overtook those games.
&#13;
Our reviewer said of Death Stranding, "There is a fascinating, fleshed-out world of supernatural science fiction to enjoy across its sprawling and spectacular map, so it’s a real shame that it’s all been saddled on a gameplay backbone that struggles to adequately support its weight over the full course of the journey." Many players looked past the gameplay struggles others experienced, or even embraced them, connecting (get it?!) with Death Stranding's creepy, cool world and characters.</description>
